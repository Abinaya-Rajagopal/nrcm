# Demo Wound Images

These images are used solely for demonstration and validation of:
- Wound segmentation
- Visual metric extraction (area, redness, exudate)
- Demo fallback when live camera input is unavailable

They are NOT used for:
- Model training or fine-tuning
- Classification or prediction
- Clinical validation or diagnosis

Healing progression in the demo is simulated using synthetic time-series data.
